# Visual implementation of A* path finding algorithm

This project implements the A* searching algortihm by taking the starting and ending points as input from the user and then visually mark the shortest possible
path between the two points. This project has been made by following the [A* Pathfinding Visualization Tutorial - Python A* Path Finding Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtiK0DOeI4A&list=PLzMcBGfZo4-kNEPqSOaglnUZz3D2R4OzY&index=3)
from Tech With Tim YouTube channel.

Built on python using Tkinter and pygame library.
